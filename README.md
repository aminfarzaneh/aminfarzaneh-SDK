#Lord Of The Rings SDK

The SDK can be deployed to a package manager like Maven.

##Maven Deployment Steps
To deploy the SDK to Maven, we can follow these steps:

Update the pom.xml file of the project to include the necessary Maven configuration, such as the group ID, artifact ID, version, dependencies, etc.
Build the project using Maven by running the following command in the terminal:

<mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">mvn clean install</mark>


This command will compile the code, run tests, and create a jar file of the SDK.
Once the build is successful, we can deploy the SDK to the Maven Central repository by running the following command:

<mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">mvn deploy</mark>

This command will upload the SDK jar file to the Maven Central repository, making it available for other developers to use in their projects.
To use the SDK in their projects, other developers can add the following dependency to their project's pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>lord-of-the-rings-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>

This will include the SDK in their project and allow them to use the provided functionalities.
